"Hey Joanne. What are you up to?"
 "I'm just watching some television."
 "I'm so bored. I don't know what I'm going to do today and it is only ten in the morning."
 "Me too. Do you think we are boring people?"
 "I don't think we are boring. It's just that we don't have any hobbies."
 "That's right. What do you think we should do as a hobby?"
 "That all depends on what you like to do. For example, I like to doodle on the notepad, so I'm thinking about doing some real drawings."
 "I like to play the piano for fun."
 "Yeah. That can be a good hobby."
 "Hobbies are great. I'm going to make a list of all the things I like to do."
 "That's a great idea. I'm going to do the same."
