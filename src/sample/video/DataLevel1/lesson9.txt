"All I do all day is work and watch TV. I really should start thinking about my health."
 "I never thought about that, but you're right. What do you think we should do?"
 "For starters, we should start doing more outdoor activities. That way we'll get some exercise."
 "I was thinking about taking tennis lessons. I always have an hour to spare in the afternoon. What do you think about that?"

 "I heard it is only about one hundred twenty dollars a month for 8 lessons."
 "Playing tennis twice a week will be a good start. Count me in."
