 "Hey Bob. Whatcha you doing?"
 "I'm at home painting."
 "I didn't know you paint. What type of painting is it?"
 "I enjoy oil painting. I learned it in one of my extra classes in college."
 "That sounds so interesting. I wish I learned a hobby."
 "Hobbies are never too late to learn. They offer a variety of classes at the local community college. You should look into it."
 "I think I will. Thanks for the info."
