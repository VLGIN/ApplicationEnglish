What should we do this Saturday?
Rocky six is suppose to come out this Friday.
Yeah, but I don't know if it is going to be any good.
The only reason I want to see it is because I have seen the previous five.
True. Ok. Let's see it this Saturday.
How about we hook up for lunch at 12:00, and then go see the movie afterwards.
Sounds like a plan. Let's meet in front of Tower Records at 12:00.
