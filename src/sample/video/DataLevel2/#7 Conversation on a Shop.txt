Excuse me. May I try this on, please?
Shop assistant: Of course, madam.
Where's the changing room?
It's over there.
Thanks.
How is it, madam?
It doesn't suit me.
What size do you take?
I'm size S.
Sorry madam. We're out of that size. Would another one with a different design do?
I only like the one with this design. Sorry, I don't want anything else.
That's ok, madam.
