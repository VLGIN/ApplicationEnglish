Michelle! What a surprise! How did you get so slim? You look so lively and fresh!
Really? Maybe it's from doing yoga the last two months. I feel so good now.
Oh, really? That's awesome. Should I take a course? Wellâ€¦ I'm doing archery right now.
Don't worry. You can do both sports at the same time. You can join the yoga class with me next Friday evening.
Sure. Why not?
