I heard you and your colleagues have just come back from the tour in China. How was your trip?
Wonderful! I've never had such a good vacation like this before. The tour guide is friendly and we went sightseeing and shopping every night.
Wow, that sounds really fun. Was it a package holiday?
Yeah. We just wanted to relax so we booked this tour. We didn't need to worry about the hotel, meals, or any other things.
Good choice. Maybe I should go there this winter holiday. There're not many tourists at that time of the year, right?
No, there aren't.
