How's the preparation? Did you pack the luggage?
Urr… I'm doing it. Urr… So many clothes to bring. The suitcase is too full already.
Honey, don't try to bring everything. Just bring what we need and we can buy some clothes there. And don't forget the camera and sunscreen. The sun on the beach is strong.
Ok, I know.
I need to go change some money now. Bye.
Bye.
