Pardon me! Could you show me the way to the airport, please?
Ok. You can go to the airport by bus or taxi. If you go by bus, the nearest bus stop is two km walking distance from here.
Oh God! What about taking a taxi?
It's nearer. The taxi stand is on Summer Street.
And how can we get there?
You go to the end of this street, turn right at the traffic light.
You go one block to the crossroads of Summer and Winter Street and see a roundabout.
There you turn left and you can see the taxi stand there.
