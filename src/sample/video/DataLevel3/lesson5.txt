Hey Steve. When's the next time you're going to play golf?
I'm going out this Saturday.
Do you already have a foursome?
Unfortunately, we do. Let's plan for something together for Wednesday. We can go right after work.
That sounds good. Where do you want to play?
We won't have much time, so let's play somewhere close to work.
How about Bellevue? It's pretty close.
How much does it cost over there?
Twilight rates are 21 dollars.
That's pretty good. Let's do it.
Aright. I'll get a tee time for Wednesday at about 4:00.
Make it 4:15. I won't get off until 4:00.
Ok. I'll call you later when I get a tee time.
Sounds good. I'll see you on Wednesday then.
Aright. Have fun on Saturday.
Will do.
