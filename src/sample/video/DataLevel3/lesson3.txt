Hey Jack. What's going on?
Hey Matt. I'm going to ask Martha to marry me?
Really? When did you decide this?
I always knew she was the one, but I decided to pop the big question about 2 weeks ago. I'm just debating on how to do it.
That's exciting man.
So how did you propose?
You shouldn't use my example. It wasn't special. I kind of wish I made it more special but it's too late now.
What do you think I should do?
There are a lot of options. You can surprise her over dinner, or ask her in a public area, or if you have the balls, ask her father in front of her.
I never thought about that.
Thought about what?
Asking her father in front of her. How do you think she will react?
I don't know. You should know how she's going to react. She is your girlfriend.
I think that's the idea I was looking for. Thanks man.
Don't mention it. Good luck. You're going to need it.
