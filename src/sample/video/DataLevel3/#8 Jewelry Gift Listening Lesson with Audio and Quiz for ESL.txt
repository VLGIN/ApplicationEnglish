I love your bracelet. When did you get it?
I got it awhile ago, but I haven't worn it much. You really like it?
Yeah. It's beautiful. Is it white gold or silver?
It's white gold.
Where did you buy it?
My boyfriend took me to the Shane Co. and he let me pick it out.
That's so sweet. What was the occasion?
That's the best part. It wasn't for anything special. He just wanted to buy me something.
You're so lucky. If he bought you something for no special day, I wonder what he would buy you for your birthday.
My birthday is coming up next month. We'll find out pretty soon.
What do you want?
I wouldn't mind a necklace. I was at the jewelry shop looking around, and they have a couple of beautiful necklaces I want.
Why not a ring?
I don't think I'm ready for a ring from him yet.
But you're ready for everything else?
Damn right.
