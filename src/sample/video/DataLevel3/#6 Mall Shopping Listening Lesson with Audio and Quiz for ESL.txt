Hey Jackie. What are you doing?
Nothing much. I'm just relaxing today. Why? What's going on?
I was thinking about heading to the mall. Do you want to go?
Are they having a sale?
Yeah. Both Bon and Nordstrom's is having there annual sale. It's a great time to buy some clothes you've been holding out on.
That sounds great. Where should we meet?
I'll meet you in front of Nordstrom's in 30 minutes.
Sounds good. See you there.
What do you think about these shoes?
They're cute. But do you think you'll wear them much?
No. Not really.
This sweater is so pretty. I love the low neck design.
I bet it's expensive.
It's on sale for $80. What do you think? Should I try them on?
For 80 bucks it looks great. Go try it on.
