What sports do you like to play?
I like baseball and basketball.
How about football?
In my country football is brand new, so I never learned the game when I was younger.
It's a very popular game in America.
Yeah. I heard a lot about it. Is it really that fun?
For me, it's one of those games that are fun to both watch and play.
Are you a football player?
No, just for fun with my friends. We play two hand touch or flag football. We're too old to play tackle football.
What is two hand touch and flag football?
Instead of tackling somebody, you just have to touch them with two hands, or if it is flag football, grab the flag that the ball carrier is wearing.
I see. It's safer then right?
Exactly. We play every Saturdays on the field by the tennis courts. If you want to learn and play a little, you're welcome to join us.
I'll give it a try. Give me a call and let's go down together.
Ok. I'll call you Saturday morning.
Great.
